        "\n",
        "    - A function is a block of code that is defind to perform a specific task,and it can be called any where.\n",
        "    EX: def sum(a,b):\n",
        "          return(a+b)\n",
        "\n",
        "    - A method is a function that is assosiated with an object.and it is define inside a class.\n",
        "    \n",
        "Q2   Explain the concept of function arguments and parameter in python.\n",
        "\n",
        "     - Function argument and parameter are fundamental concepts in defining and calling a function.\n",
        "\n",
        "     -PARAMETER: are the variables that are listed while making a fuction.EX: def sum(a,b):      #here a and b are the parameters.\n",
        "       print(\"sum\",a+b)\n",
        "\n",
        "     -ARGUMENTS: are the actual values or data you provide to a fuction after calling it.EX: sum(4,6) so it will print the sum of 4+5 and here 4 and 5 are the arguments that are the values assigned to parameter.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q3   What are the differnt ways to define and call a function.\n",
        "      \n",
        "     - There are several ways to define and call a fuction:\n",
        "       1)STANDARD FUNCTION\n",
        "         DEFINE:for making a fuction we need to use def keyword followed by function name and parameters inside parentheses.EX- def greet(\"name\"): print(f\"hello(name)\")\n",
        "         CALL: Use function name and write argument inside parentheses.EX- greet(\"sakshi\") if you call greet funtion it will return hello followed by the name you have given as a argument.\n",
        "\n",
        "       2)FUNCTION WITH DEFAULT VALUES\n",
        "         DEFINE: while making a fuction assign default value to the parameter so that if after calling a fuction if you forgot to assign some argument to the parameter so it will not show any error but shows the default value.EX- def sum(a=0,b=0,c=0,d=45):print(\"sum\",a+b+c+d)\n",
        "         CALL: You can call the function with or without providing argument to the default parameter.EX: sum() if you call this fuction without providing any argument.it will not show any error it will show sum 45 because all parameters have the default values.\n",
        "\n",
        "       3)FUNCTION WITH VARIABLES LENGTH ARGUMENTS\n",
        "         DEFINE: Use *args inside parenthese in place of parameters for variable length positional argument.EX- def sum_all(*args):return sum(args)\n",
        "         CALL: Pass multiple values as much as needed as arguments.EX- sum_all(2,4,5,3,7) so it will return sum of all the numbers you have passed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q4    What are the purpose of return statement in python function?\n",
        "\n",
        "      - The purpose of the return statement in a python function is to send a result back to caller.it allows the function to provide an output after performing its operation.EX- def substract(a,b):print(a-b) so in this print statement will return the result back to the caller.\n",

        "\n",
        "     -A generator in python is a special type of function that allows you to generate a sequence of values one at a time,instead of returning all values at once like a regular function.this is helpful when working with large dataset becuase it saves memory.EX- def count_up_to(max)\n",
        "\n",
        "Q7   What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n",
        "\n",
        "     -There are many Advantages of using generators over a regular function:-\n",
        "      1) Generators donot store all the values in memory at onces.they generate values one at a time when needed,because of this generators are memory efficient.\n",
        "\n",
        "      2) Genrators only calculate values when they are required.this means they donot do unneccesery work,which can improve performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "      3) Genrators are often easier to write and more readable for iterating over data compared to creating complex loop.\n",

        "Q8   What is a lambda function in python and when is it typically used?\n",
        "\n",
        "     - A lambda function in python is a small ,simple function that is defined using the lambda keyword.it can take any no. of input but only has one line of code that gets executed,and it automatically returns a result.EX- add = lambda x,y:x+b\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "     1)map(): Transform each element in an iterable by applying a given function after this it returns a new iterable containing result of applied function.you can use map() when you want to perform a specific operation on every item in an iterable.EX: map(function,iterable)\n",
        "\n",
        "     2)reduce(): applies a two argument function cumulatively to the item in an iterable reducing it to single value.you can use reduce() if you want to combine all elements of an iterable into a single value.EX: (SUM,PRODUCT,CONCATENATION)\n",
        "\n",
        "     3)filter(): filter elements from an iterable based on whether they satisfy a condition and it will return a new iterable  containg the elements only which satisfy the given condition. you can use filter() if you want to select specific item from an iterable based on a condition.\n",
